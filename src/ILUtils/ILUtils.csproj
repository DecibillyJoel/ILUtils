    When adding additional references, ensure you use <Private>false</Private> to
    ensure the DLL is explicitly NOT copied to the output directory. This is because
    the DLLs are already included in the game and will be loaded from there.

    Further, if the DLL is not included as part of the game, you should be using a
    Dependency in your thunderstore.toml file to ensure the DLL is available to the
    game when your mod is loaded.

    Example: <Reference Include="Assembly-CSharp.dll" Private="false" />
